Installing beepbeep:

Installing beepbeep should (hopefully) be fairly straigth forward.  You will 
need gcc to be installed because the actual beep executable is compiled during
the installation.  You also need to be root to install and run beepbeep.  

1.  Extract tarball to the directory of your chosing:
	tar -xvpjf ./beepbeep.version.tar.bz2
	cd beepbeep

2.  Run ./install_beepbeep.py 
	It will ask you for 2 questions, where do you want to put the executables and
	where to do want to put the songs.  If you don't care, just press enter on both
	of them to accept the defaults.  Otherwise you can specifify your own directories.
	
	Ultimately the directory locations get written to /etc/beepbeep.conf
	that beepbeep references.
	
	You can re-run install_beepbeep.py to either re-install (to the same or different
	directory) or remove beepbeep together.  If you created any custom songs, be sure
	to back them up if you are removing beeepbeep, as the songs will get deleted. 

3.  To run beepbeep, simply type: beepbeep
	To see different options try: beepbeep --help
