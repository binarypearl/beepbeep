# HOWTO create your own beepbeep song.
#
# 1.  Copy the file songs/template_song.pl and re-name it to a file name of your choice.
#	(Keep your new song file in the songs/ directory.
# 2.  Modify the value passed into set_tempo().  This is tempo that the song 
#       will play at in BPM (Beats Per Minute).  If you don't know what to 
#       set it to, leave it at 115 and adjust accordingly during or after
#       writing the song.
# 3.  Write your song.  You want to start modifying the contents after the line:
#        my $song = join (":", <<SONG =~  /(.+)/g);
#
#    Here is how it works:  
#       To form a note, here is the general syntax:
#       $length $note -n
#       
#       So lets say you want to play a C quarter note:
#       $quarter $CN4 -n 
#       
#       This means play a quater note, with the note being a C Natural in the 4th
#       ocatve.  I believe $CN4 is Middle C on the keyboard for reference.
#       You have all the way from octave 0 to octate 8.  Although I don't know the
#       frequencies beyond $Eb8, so that's the highest you can get for now.  
#       
#       Sharps are indicated by a 'S' in the 2nd character of the variable.  
#       Flats are indicated by a 'b' in the 2nd character of the variable.
#       Notes with an equivilant sharp and flat (ex:  $DS5 and $Eb4) are set
#       to the same frequency, thus they are the same note. 
#       
#
#       IMPORTANT NOTES (pun somewhat intended):
#       The length must come before the note. 
#       You MUST have a space after each -n .  Otherwise the song won't play right.
#       You MUST NOT have a -n on the last note of the song.  Otherwise you will
#               get an unintentional default beep at the end of the song.
#
#       Rest Notes:  
#       These are a bit tricky, as I don't have a way right now to play rest notes
#       by themselves.  So if you want a quarter note rest for example, you need
#       to use the $quarter_rest on the note before the rest should occur.  Here is 
#       small song that plays a C quarter note on beats 1 and 3, but rests on beat's
#       2 and 4:
#
#       $quarter $CN4 $quarter_rest -n 
#       $quarter $CN4 $quarter_rest
#
#       
#       Reference:  Here is list of lengths that you can use:
#       NOTES:
#
#       Whole Note:                                  $whole
#       Dotted Half Note:                            $dottedhalf
#       Half Note with a slide to an Eighth Note:    $half_slide_eighth
#       Half Note with a slide to a Sixteenth Note:  $half_slide_sixteenth
#       Half Note:                                   $half      
#       Dotted Quarter Note:                         $dottedquarter
#       Quarter Note:                                $quarter
#       Eighth Note:                                 $eighth
#       Sixteenth Note:                              $sixteenth
#
#       RESTS:
#               
#       Whole Rest:                                  $whole_rest
#       Dotted Half Rest:                            $dottedhalf_rest
#       Half Note with a slide to an Eighth Rest:    $half_slide_eighth_rest
#       Half Note with a slide to a Sixteenth Rest:  $half_slide_sixteenth_rest
#       Half Rest:                                   $half_rest 
#       Dotted Quarter Rest:                         $dottedquarter_rest
#       Quarter Rest:                                $quarter_rest
#       Eighth Rest:                                 $eighth_rest
#       Sixteenth Rest:                              $sixteenth_rest
