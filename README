Introduction:
  beepbeep is a CLI and menu based tool to play songs through a computers PC speaker.  We are leveraging an enhanced version of the beep binary (http://www.johnath.com/beep/) that allows us to specify both frequency and durations.  This gives us great flexibility to create melodies.  We also have a perl API that allows for easier creation of songs.

Notable songs included in this beepbeep package:
Entry of the Gladiators
Final Fantasy VI – Decisive Battle
Final Fantasy X – On to Zanarkand
